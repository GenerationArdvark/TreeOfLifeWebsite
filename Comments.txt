Here are my thoughts as of May 18, 2021


I took the time to touch up all of the photos that were in the repository using affinity photo so they should look a bit better.  I also renamed them.

Some site modifications like setting up the slideshow can probably be easily implemented.  I will see if I can find the page wher eit has a slideshow on the boot strap site:

https://getbootstrap.com/


I can think of some other minor styling changes like gradients on the header and footer / navbar and perhaps a background that is not super bright...


I like the donation paypal button upfront on the main page.
